  "description": "- Teams have to create a fork of this particular repo on start of hackathon.\r - Rename the repo as per the team name when you create the fork\r - Once you select the problem statement that you are going to work on, create a file as initial.md and give your team name, team members name and the problem statement you are trying to solve. Do this within first one hour of starting the hackathon. \r - At the end of hackathon timing, STGI team will create a copy all the repos that are forked and only that will be used for evaluation. So ensure the code is committed to the forked repo only.\r - Do continuous commits to your own forks so that we can evaluate the commit history as well.\r - You can place your presentation and videos if any within the same repo by creating a new folder.",
